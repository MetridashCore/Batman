                    Payment and pricing terms for the Service are as specified
                    in the order form utilized to order such subscriptions. By
                    selecting a premium service you agree to pay Metridash the
                    monthly or annual subscription fees indicated for that
                    service. Payments will be charged on the day you sign up for
                    a premium service and will cover the use of that service for
                    a monthly or annual period as indicated. Premium service
                    fees are not refundable. Metridash offers monthly and annual
                    subscriptions that renew until they are canceled by the
                    user. Your subscription will automatically renew for another
                    period unless notice of non-renewal is provided. Your notice
                    of non-renewal must be received before the renewal period
                    begins. You will be billed for the Service until you
                    properly cancel your account or Metridash terminates your
                    account. Your cancellation may not take effect until
                    completion of the current billing cycle. Prices for the
                    Service are subject to change upon 30 days notice from
                    Metridash. This notice may be posted on the Metridash
                    website or may appear with the Service itself. If you do not
                    agree to the price change(s), you may cancel your account
                    during this 30-day period. By continuing to use the Service
                    after the effective date of a pricing change, you thereby
                    agree to such pricing change. Metridash shall not be liable
                    to you or to any third party for any modifications to the
